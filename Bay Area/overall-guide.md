# The Guide to the Bay Area

## 🚃 Transportation

- Public transport
    - If you're outside SF, not much usable stuff exists other than the Caltrain
    - Google Maps public transport does a pretty good job of displaying Caltrain schedules at each station. Note that some stations are serviced less than others (your best bets are the bigger stations, because the express trains stop there).
    - Clipper Cards: you can (well, have to) use this for any and all transportation in the Bay Area Peninsula. A new one costs $3 (I think). You can use them on:
        - Caltrain: Make sure to tap on AND OFF. You’ll get charged for the full-ride otherwise.
        - Bay Wheels: more details below. But you can use it in person at the racks.
        - BART: the rail that transports you between the farther out burbs to inside SF, from South SF to Oakland.
        - Muni: Rail cars within SF
        - Busses: I personally don’t have a lot of info here but they *should* take it???
        - **Bonus**: Most companies have WageWorks – sign up for a commuter card so you can use pre-tax (or in some companies, it's a benefit) money to load up your card.
- Specific to San Francisco
    - You can rent e-bikes, bikes, and scooters by the minute.
    - Bay Wheels x Lyft means you can find bikes for use in the Lyft app. Lime scoots are also available. Big strat is to rent the Bay Wheel bikes 20 minutes at a time (they’re free) — the only thing that sucks are the hills.
    - Do not underestimate the size of SF. Going from the west side to east takes at least 45 minutes by car, and that's without traffic.
- Otherwise your main mode of transportation is cars.
    - You can rent them whenever you need them, and normally the bigger companies (Google, MS, Apple etc) have discount codes so they waive <25yo fees and give you a discount.
    - You can also buy one secondhand and resell it at the end of your internship if you’re better at negotiating. More details under “furnishings”.
    - Note: driving in SF is a bitch, not only because of the hills (RIP manuals) but also because of car break-ins (happens to every damn car that has anything in sight of the window) and the streets are all fucky. If you park on a hill, make sure to turn your wheels – they WILL ticket you if you don’t.
    - Highways: the main ones (equivalent to the 401) are Highway 101 and 280. The 280 is fucking pristine; the 101 is filled with potholes. Easy access to either will make traveling up and down the Peninsula much easier.

## 🛋️ Furnishings and First Purchases

- Secondhand markets
    - This is THE way to be not only eco-friendly but also save fat dough. The Bay Area has a thriving market, unlike a lot of the GTA. (Shameless plug: check out @jennysconsumptionguide for a breakdown on how much we’ve saved by doing this).
    - Always negotiate and try not to get scammed. Good markets are Facebook marketplace and Craigslist. Use your stranger danger radars; meet in public spaces, and don’t give people money before seeing the actual thing.
        - Tip: Sort by city/postal code and radius, for pick-up.
    - Payment is usually cash or Venmo. To do Venmo, you’ll need a bank account. See “Money” for more details.
- Buy Nothing Groups
    - These are incredible Facebook-based hyper-local gifting communities. The Bay Area is privileged enough to have a thriving community here too. Introduce yourself and ask for help and your neighbours are more than likely to have extra things that you might find useful – and it’ll also be a way for you to gift anything at the end of your internship. Did I mention all of this is FREE?
    - Find your group at [https://buynothingproject.org/find-a-group/#CA](https://buynothingproject.org/find-a-group/#CA) . Make sure to read through the rules so you’re socially aware.
    - In a similar vein is Nextdoor (an app), but geared more towards the community aspect. They also have a marketplace you can check out.
- Amazon Prime
    - US accounts are not the same as Canadian ones unfortunately. Would advise sharing an account with your fellow interns to shamelessly save money. 1-day, 2-day deliveries are everywhere.
    - Note: package stealing is rampant, particularly in San Francisco (even in gated complexes) and porch pirates also exist in the South Bay suburbs. Make sure nothing is left out for too long and you give proper instructions to the delivery guy.
- Costco

    - Canadian memberships hold their value here! Pretty much the same thing as in Canada but with alcohol and churros, minus the poutine. Great place to get alcohol en-masse for any parties.

## 🏦 Money

- How to get a bank account
    1. Get an SSN. This should be one of the first things on your list when you land. Check the website for the documentation requirements – double check – **and then bring more**. The last thing you want is to wait in line for 3 hours only to get turned around. Go and line up at the office 30 minutes before it opens to reduce your time in waiting.
        - This will make it much easier for you later on as you open accounts and get paid and whatnot.
    2. Bring your offer letter. Just in case; oftentimes there are weird perks that come with this. More on this later on, under credit cards.
    3. Bring your passport.
    4. Bring cash. At least $200 to open your account with.
    5. Ask for blank cheques. This is useful for when you have to pay rent.
    - Note: I recommend going to the larger banks for this stuff, i.e. Bank of America or Chase. BoA is handy for if you get a credit card. For anybody working at Apple, you are a Preferred Member if you set up direct deposit for your paycheques to the account.
- How to get a credit card
    - This one’s a bit tricky, but possible. Once you have an SSN and a bank account for a while, you can try going to Bank of America – they’re the only ones who will give you a card. If you have your offer letter from a big company alongside listed annual salary, the right associate will usually know enough to file a special request (with the offer letter as proof) to get you approved. Building credit early on is pretty handy, so it’s worth a shot to do this.
    - Alternatively you can get some sort of security card where you put down money that then becomes your limit. Not great, but lets you start building credit.
- Venmo: an informal, more ubiquitous American E-transfer
    - Once you have a bank account, you can open a Venmo account. This form of payment is often equivalent to cash around here, so merchants who take cash only can also take Venmo – which is handy when you just don’t have the cash. It’ll also make it easier for you to pay people when you inevitably go out for things. Even clubs take Venmo.
- Currency Transfer
    - Most of us use friends, or Transferwise. I haven't done this in a long time though, so I'm sure there are more updated resources elsewhere on the topic.

## 🏠 Living Locations

- Places to avoid
    - SF Tenderloin: if you ever go to SF and walk around, and suddenly the buildings are dilapidated and people are shooting up on sidewalks, you’ve likely wandered into the Tenderloin. Strongly advise against going here in anything but broad daylight – definitely do not get a place here. It’ll be dirt cheap, but probably dangerous.
    - SF SOMA: Kinda nasty but not as bad as Tenderloin
    - East Palo Alto: it’s becoming gentrified but still a little sketchy. It’s also far from highways and any public transportation. Gotta love systemic disparities!
    - San Jose: butt-far from your friends and on the wrong end of the Peninsula for an internship. Only plus is much cheaper housing is found as you get closer to it (ex. Palo Alto > Mountain View > Sunnyvale > Santa Clara > San Jose prices, with about 10% drops between each city’s rent).
- Places to look at
    - Living within walk or biking distance near a main Caltrain station is pretty advantageous especially if you don’t have a car.
    - Some cities and their corresponding main street for downtown:
        - San Mateo > 3rd Ave: has a thriving downtown with lots of Asian eats.
        - Palo Alto > University Ave: is dumb expensive with corresponding hip vibes. Contrary to popular belief, minimal Stanford students frequent here.
    - Mountain View > Castro St: Smaller downtown but with plenty of food options.
    - Sunnyvale > Murphy St: Even smaller “downtown” but still a plethora of food options.
    - Cupertino has a nice little “Main Street” that can keep one entertained.

## 🛂 Identity

- SSN
    - See Money > How to get a bank account
- Visas
    - J1: One of the more commonly used visas, designed specifically for internships.
    - TN: One of the second-most used visas. Thanks to NAFTA, it makes it easy for **certain** professional classes to work in Canada/US/Mexico. This also means that if you spin your internship the wrong way such that it doesn't classify as one of these classes, you might get denied entry. To be clear, you **should not lie to a border patrol officer**. That's literally illegal. But you should definitely say things like "engineer" instead of "developer" or "technician". Because "engineer" is an approved class, but "developer" isn't in the verbiage yet (Thank you, slow legislation!)
    - H1B: Likely not relevant unless you're international. Very hard to get. Happy to share more details if it's relevant.
- Driving license

    - Your Canadian one will do when you’re only out here for 4 months. Note: Americans will be confused by your birthday, because we reverse the order, and bouncers cover the date with their thumb.
